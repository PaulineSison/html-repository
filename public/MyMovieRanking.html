<h1>The Best Movies According To Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Memoir of a Snail</h3>
<p>This is one my favorite movies because not only it is entertaining, but it somehow depicts life's balance of bitter-sweet moments that surely many audiences will relate to. </p>
<h3>The Little Prince</h3>
<p>This movie also earns a spot in my favorites because it makes you wonder about life and all of the lessons that you get along the way as you go through it.</option>
<h3>Amelie</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it is very eccentric, artsy, and comedic. Very entertaining! It has a bit of everything into it. It is very fun to watch!</p>
